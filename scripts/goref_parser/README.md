## GO_REF parser

The intention of this parser utility is to retroactively consolidate all the gorefs that are currently within the [gorefs](../../metadata/gorefs/) folder into a single YAML data structure with information from all the GO_REFs.

### Run parser

```bash
python scripts/goref_parser/parser.py
```
