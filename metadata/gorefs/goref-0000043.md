## Gene Ontology annotation based on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot keyword mapping

Transitive assignments using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot keywords. The UniProtKB keyword controlled vocabulary contains 10 different categories of information to UniProtKB entries. Further information on the UniProtKB keyword resource can be found at https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/.
UniProtKB keywords are assigned to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries by UniProt curators as part of the UniProtKB manual curation process. UniProtKB keywords are also automatically assigned to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation program.
Further information on the two different UniProt annotation methods is available at https://www.uniprot.org/help/keywords..
When a UniProtKB keyword describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, a mapping is manually made to the corresponding GO term.The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB keywords is maintained by the EBI GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/uniprotkb_kw2go.
