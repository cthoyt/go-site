  UniProtKB entries
comments:
- Active 2001-2007.
- Method by which GO terms were manually assigned to UniProt KnowledgeBase accessions,
  using either a NAS or TAS evidence code, by applying information extracted from
  the corresponding publicly-available, manually curated UniProtKB entry. Such GO
  annotations were submitted by the GOA-UniProt group from 2001, but this annotation
  practice was discontinued in 2007.

  Subcellular Location terms in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.
comments:
- Transitive assignment of GO terms based on the UniProtKB Subcellular Location vocabulary.
  UniProtKB Subcellular Location is a controlled vocabulary used to supply subcellular
  location information to UniProtKB entries in the SUBCELLULAR LOCATION lines. Terms
  from this vocabulary are annotated manually to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. Further
  information on the UniProtKB manual annotation method is available at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45.<br>When
  a UniProtKB Subcellular Location term describes a concept that is within the scope
  of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate
  to map the term to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB Subcellular
  Location terms and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies
  of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect
  the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB
  Subcellular Location terms is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at
  http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/spsl2go.

  have, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) curators append the GO terms associated with
  the orthologous gene(s) to the mouse gene. Only those GO terms assigned by experimental

comments:

  IDA (ECO:0000314), IEP (ECO:0000270), ISS (ECO:0000250), IGC (ECO_0000317), RCA
  (ECO:0000245) and IEA (ECO:0000501) to annotate gene products from PAMGO_MGG. Standard
  BLASTP from NCBI was used (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast) to iteratively search
  reciprocal best hits and thus identify orthologs between predicted proteins of Magnaporthe
  grisea and GO proteins from multiple organisms with published association to GO
  terms. The alignments were manually reviewed for those hits with e-value equal to
  zero and with 80% or better coverage of both query and subject sequences, and for
  those hits with e&lt;=10^-20, pid &gt;=35 and sequence coverage &gt;=80%. Furthermore,
  experimental or reviewed data from literature and other sources were incorporated
  into the GO annotation. IDA was assigned to an annotation if normal function of
  its gene was determined through transfections into a cell line and overexpression.
  IEP was assigned to an annotation if according to microarray experiments, its gene
  was upregulated in a biological process and the fold change was equal to or bigger
  than 10, or if according to Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS), its
  gene was upregulated only in a certain biological process and the fold change was
  equal to or bigger than 10. ISS was assigned to an annotation if the entry at the
  With_column was experimentally characterized and the pairwise alignments were manually
  reviewed. IGC was assigned to an annotation if it based on comparison and analysis
  of gene location and structure, clustering of genes, and phylogenetic reconstruction
  of these genes. RCA was assigned to an annotation if it based on integrated computational
  analysis of whole genome microarray data, and matches to InterPro, pfam, and COG
  etc. IEA was assigned to an annotation if its function assignment based on computational
  work, and no manual review was done.

title: OBSOLETE Taxon constraints to detect inconsistencies in annotation and ontology
  structure.
comments:
- 'GO is intended to cover the full range of species, therefore GO terms are defined
  to be taxon neutral, avoiding reliance on taxon information for full definition
  of the given process, function, or component. For certain terms, however, there
  is obvious implicit taxon specificity, such that the term should only be used to
  categorize gene products from particular species. Taxon specificity of GO terms
  is captured using relationships such as "only_in_taxon" and "never_in_taxon". All
  taxon constraints are inherited by sub-types and parts of the GO term they are applied
  to. Taxon constraints are used to prevent inappropriate annotations from being made
  by curators as well as to identify pre-existing annotations that violate the taxon
  constraints. Errors in annotations are automatically detected by looking for inconsistencies
  between the taxonomic origin of the annotated gene products and the implicit taxon
  specificity of the GO terms. The inconsistencies are passed on to curators for correction,
  in some cases the constraints need to be tightened or relaxed or the structure of
  the ontology needs to be adjusted. The taxon constraints are further described in
  this publication: Deegan, Dimmer and Mungall. BMC Bionformatics (2010) Formalization
  of taxon-based constraints to detect inconsistencies in annotaiton and ontology

title: OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation by CACAO biocurators
comments:
- This GO reference describes the criteria used by biocurators participating in the
  Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies (CACAO) to annotate
  gene products from genomes of interest through the use of computational methods
  to establish and manually validate function or homology to gene products. In particular,
  this GO reference describes the criteria used to make annotations based on evidence
  codes ISS, ISA, ISO, ISM and IGC. To perform ISS-, ISA-, and ISO-based annotations
  on a gene product, CACAO biocurators use sequence- and structure-based search algorithms
  (e.g. BLASTP, HHPred) to establish homology, conservation of sequence and structure
  functional determinants between the target gene product and gene products from other
  organisms with published GO annotations supported by experimental codes and lacking
  NOT qualifiers. These gene products are referenced in the WITH field of the annotation
  using their xref database accession. ISM-based annotations make use of published
  computational methods (e.g. TMHMM, SignalP) to predict gene product structure, localization
  or function. IGC-based annotations are made on the basis of suggestive evidence
  for function based on synteny. Parameters and criteria for use of all computational
  methods (e.g. e-value) are listed and versioned in the publicly available CACAO
  documentation (http://gowiki.tamu.edu/). Annotations made by CACAO biocurators are
  reviewed by CACAO team instructors before their release.

title: OBSOLETE Improving the representation of muscle biology in the biological process

comments:
- 'A meeting focused on the biology of skeletal and smooth muscle has been held on
  24-25 July 2007 at the University of Padua, Italy, as a collaboration with the GO
  consortium and CRIBI Biotechnology Center. The aims of this effort were to provide
  a comprehensive representation of muscle biology in the biological process and cellular
  component ontologies and to improve the organization of muscle-specific terms to
  better describe the current knowledge of biological mechanisms in muscle tissue.
  Thus, the collaboration brought together experts in several areas of muscle biology
  and physiology who carried out a thorough review of the existing GO muscle terms
  as these terms were largely created by non-muscle experts using older definitions.
  In particular, several areas are being addressed actively in current research: the
  biological processes of muscle contraction, muscle plasticity, muscle development,
  and muscle regeneration; and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and membrane delimited compartments.
  This work resulted in the addition of 159 new terms and in the modification of 57
  terms to bring them in line with current usage. Funding for the meeting was provided
  by Italian Telethon Foundation.'

title: Pairwise alignment (TIGR)
comments:
- 'Pairwise alignments are generated by taking two sequences and aligning them so
  that the maximum number of amino acids in each protein match, or are similar to,
  each other. Tools such as BLAST work by comparing a protein-of-interest individually
  with every protein in a database of known protein sequences and retaining only those
  matches with a high probability of being significant. Basic BLAST generates local
  alignments between proteins for regions of high similarity. Other pairwise alignment
  tools attempt to generate global (full-length) protein alignments. A tool called
  Blast_Extend_repraze (BER, http://ber.sourceforge.net) has some benefits over basic
  BLAST. Input into the BER tool includes the underlying DNA sequence for each protein
  as well as 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted boundaries of
  the protein coding sequence. This allows annotators to see the DNA sequence that
  underlies the query protein as part of the alignment. In addition, the BER tool
  is able to look for continuation of regions of similarity through frameshifts and
  in-frame stop codons.  If such regions are found the alignment is continued. BER
  searches are done in a two-step process: step one is a BLAST search against a non-redundant
  protein database, significant BLAST hits are stored in a mini-database for each
  query protein; step two is a modified Smith-Waterman alignment between the query
  and the proteins in its mini-database. In order to assess whether a given BER alignment
  is good enough to assert that the query shares the function of the match protein,
  one must look at a several factors. First of all, the match protein must itself
  be experimentally characterized in order to avoid transitive annotation errors.
  In addition, any residues or secondary structures known to be important for function
  in the match protein must be conserved in the query. The alignment should be visually
  inspected to look for any areas of lesser quality that might indicate the two proteins
  do not share the same function. Although it is impossible to set cutoff values for
  percent identity and length of match that will apply for every alignment, there
  are some guidelines. In general at least 40% identity that extends over the full
  lengths of both proteins is required in order to even consider functional equivalence.
  However, this percentage is highly dependent on the length and complexity of the
  proteins. 40% identity between two proteins 500 amino acids long is much more significant
  that 40% identity between two proteins that are only 100 amino acids long. Therefore,
  the annotator''s experience and knowledge of what is considered significant for
  the organism and protein family in question is very important. Some sets of proteins
  are much more highly conserved than others and therefore tolerances for percent
  identity may have to be adjusted. Finally, the alignment must be considered in the
  context of what else is known about the query protein and the organism as a whole.'

title: Manual annotations that require more than one source of functional data to
  support the assignment of the associated GO term
comments:
- The Gene Ontology Consortium uses the IC (Inferred by Curator) evidence code when
  an annotation cannot be supported by any direct evidence, but can be inferred by
  GO annotations that have been annotated to the same gene/gene product identifier
  in conjunction with the curator's knowledge of biology (supporting GO annotations
  must not be IC-evidenced). In many cases an IC-evidenced annotation simply applies
  the same reference that was used in the supporting GO annotation.  The use of IC
  evidence code in an annotation with reference GO_REF:0000036 signifies a curator
  inferred the GO term based on evidence from multiple sources of evidence/GO annotations.
  The 'with/from' field in these annotations will therefore supply more than one GO
  identifier, obtained from the set of supporting GO annotations assigned to the same
  gene/gene product identifier which cite publicly-available references.

title: Gene Ontology annotation based on absence of key sequence residues.
comments:
- This describes a method for supplying a NOT-qualified, IKR-evidenced GO annotation
  to a gene product, when general sequence homology considerations would suggest a
  function or location, or a role in a biological process, but where a curator has
  determined that the absence of key sequence residues, known to be required for an
  expected activity or location, indicating the gene product is unlikely to be able
  to carry out the implied activity, involvement in a process or cellular component
  location. This reference should only be used used when an IKR-evidenced annotation
  is made based on curator judgement from manually reviewing the sequence of the gene
  product and where no publication can be found to support the curators conclusion.
  It is preferable to cite a peer-reviewed publication (such as a PubMed identifier)
  for IKR-evidenced annotations whenever possible. Curators will have carefully reviewed
  the sequence of the annotated protein, and established that the key residues known
  to be required for an expected activity or location are not present. Inclusion of
  an identifier in the 'with/from' field, that highlights to the user the lacking
  residues(e.g. an alignment, domain or rule identifier) is absolutely required when
  annotating to IKR with this GO_REF. Documentation on the GOC website provides more
  details on the <a href = "http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#ikr">correct
  use of the IKR evidence code</a>.

title: Improving the representation of immunology in the biological process Ontology
comments:
- GO terms describing processes, functions, and cellular components related to the
  immune system have existed in the GO from its beginning and been used extensively
  in the annotation of gene products. However, particularly in the biological process
  ontology, the initial set of terms relating to immunology failed to cover the breadth
  of known immunological processes, and in many cases diverged from current usage
  and understanding in their names, definitions, and ontological placement. As part
  of a larger effort to improve the representation of immunology in the GO, a GO Content
  Meeting was held November 15-16, 2005, at The Institute for Genomic Research, to
  discuss improvements to representation of immunology in the biological process ontology
  of the GO. As a result of the meeting, a number of high level terms for immunological
  processes were created, an overall structure for immunologically related terms was
  established, and certain existing terms were renamed or redefined as well to bring
  them in line with current usage.

title: OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation by the MGI curatorial staff, Mouse Locus
  Catalog
comments:
- For annotations documented via this citation, curators used the information in the
  Mouse Locus Catalog in MGI to assign GO terms. The GO terms were assigned based
  on MLC textual descriptions of genes that could not be traced to the primary literature.
  Details of this strategy can be found in Hill et al, Genomics (2001) 74:121-128.

title: Electronic Gene Ontology annotations created by ARBA machine learning models
comments:
- ARBA predicts Gene Ontology (GO) terms among other types of functional annotation
  such as Protein Description (DE), Keywords (KW), Enzyme Commission numbers (EC),
  sucellular LOcation (LO), etc. For all annotation types, reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
  records having manual annotations as reference data are used to perform the machine
  learning phase and generate prediction models. For GO terms, ARBA has an additional
  feature to augment reference data using the relations between GO terms in the GO
  graph. The data augmentation is based on adding more general annotations into records
  containing manual GO terms, which will result in richer reference data. The predicted
  GO terms are then propagated to all unreviewed UniProtKB/TrEMBL proteins that meet
  the conditions of ARBA models. GO annotations using this technique receive the evidence
  code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA; ECO:0000501). These annotations are
  updated regularly by UniProt and are available for download on both the GO and GOA
  EBI ftp sites.

title: Operon structure as IGC evidence
comments:
- Genes in prokaryotic organisms are often arranged in operons. Genes in an operon
  are all transcribed into one mRNA. Generally the genes in the operons code for proteins
  that all have related functions. For example, they may be the steps in a biochemical
  pathway, or they may be the subunits of a protein complex. Often the genes in operons
  shared between organisms are syntenic; that is, the same genes are in the same order
  in the operon in different species. When assessing sequence-comparison-based evidence
  during the process of manual annotation of a genome, it is often the case that some
  of the genes in the operon will have strong sequence-based evidence while others
  will have weak evidence. If seen alone, not in the presence of an operon, the weak
  evidence in question may not be sufficient to make a functional annotation. However,
  in the presence of an operon in which there is strong evidence for some of the genes,
  the very presence of the gene in the operon is a strong indication that the gene
  shares in the process carried out by the operon. If the putative function is one
  expected to exist for the process in question and particularly if that function
  has been observed in the same operon in another species, then the annotation should
  be made. This type of evidence is inferred from the context of the gene in an operon,
  and therefore the evidence code is IGC "inferred from genomic context."

title: OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation by SEA-PHAGE biocurators
comments:
- This GO reference describes the criteria used by biocurators of the SEA-PHAGE consortium
  for the annotation of predicted gene products from newly sequenced bacteriophage
  genomes in the SEA-PHAGE phagesdb.org and other databases and in the GenBank records
  periodically released to NCBI for these genomes. In particular, this GO reference
  describes the criteria used to assign evidence codes ISS, ISA, ISO, ISM, IGC and
  ND. To assign ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM evidence codes, SEA-PHAGE biocurators use a
  varied array of bioinformatics tools to establish homology and conservation of sequence
  and structure functional determinants with proteins from multiple organisms with
  published association to experimental GO terms and lacking NOT qualifiers. These
  proteins are referenced in the WITH field of the annotation using their xref database
  accession. The primary tools for homology search in ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM assignments
  are BLASTP and HHpred, using a maximum e-value of 10^-7 for BLASTP and a minimum
  probability of 0.9 for HHpred, and manual inspection of alignments in both cases.
  For ISS and ISA assignments, BLASTP alignments are required to have at least 75%
  coverage and 30% identity. For ISO assignments, orthology is further validated using
  reciprocal BLASTP with the identified hit. For HHpred results, ISS or ISM annotations
  are made only if the source for the original GO annotation explicitly defines a
  matched domain function, or if more than half of the domains of the query protein
  are identified in the matching protein. All ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM assignments entail
  the manual verification of the source for the GO term in the matching protein sequence
  and critical curator assessment of the likelihood of preservation of function, process
  or component in the context of bacteriophage biology. IGC codes are assigned on
  the basis of suggestive evidence for function based on synteny, as inferred from
  whole-genome comparative analyses of multiple bacteriophage genomes using primarily
  the Phamerator software platform, and with special emphasis on the bacteriophage
  virion structure and assembly genes. When extensive review of published literature
  on putative homologs reveals no experimental evidence of function, component or
  process for a particular gene product, it is assigned an ND evidence code and annotated
  to the root term for Cellular Component, Molecular Function and Biological Process.
  As part of the review process for assignment of ISS, ISA, ISO, IGC and ISM evidence
  codes, SEA-PHAGE curators are required to analyze the reference literature for identified
  matches and shall perform GO annotations with appropriate evidence codes if these
  were not available.

  Subcellular Location terms in UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries.
comments:
- Transitive assignment of GO terms based on the UniProtKB Subcellular Location vocabulary.
  UniProtKB Subcellular Location is a controlled vocabulary used to supply subcellular
  location information to UniProtKB entries in the SUBCELLULAR LOCATION lines. Terms
  from this vocabulary are applied automatically to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from
  the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation
  program. Further information on the UniProtKB automatic annotation program is available
  at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45.<br>When a UniProtKB Subcellular Location term
  describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated
  to determine whether it is appropriate to map the term to an equivalent term in
  GO. The mapping between UniProtKB Subcellular Location terms and GO terms is carried
  out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are
  compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence.
  The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB Subcellular Location terms
  is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/spsl2go.

title: Hidden Markov Models (TIGR)
comments:
- A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical representation of patterns found in
  a data set. When using HMMs with proteins, the HMM is a statistical model of the
  patterns of the amino acids found in a multiple alignment of a set of proteins called
  the "seed". Seed proteins are chosen based on sequence similarity to each other.
  Seed members can be chosen with different levels of relationship to each other.
  They can be members of a superfamily (ex. ABC transporter, ATP-binding proteins),
  they can all share the same exact specific function (ex. biotin synthase) or they
  could share another type of relationship of intermediate specificity (ex. subfamily,
  domain). New proteins can be scored against the model generated from the seed according
  to how closely the patterns of amino acids in the new proteins match those in the
  seed. There are two scores assigned to the HMM which allow annotators to judge how
  well any new protein scores to the model. Proteins scoring above the "trusted cutoff"
  score can be assumed to be part of the group defined by the seed. Proteins scoring
  below the "noise cutoff" score can be assumed to NOT be a part of the group. Proteins
  scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs may be part of the group but may not.
  One of the important features of HMMs is that they are built from a multiple alignment
  of protein sequences, not a pairwise alignment. This is significant, since shared
  similarity between many proteins is much more likely to indicate shared functional
  relationship than sequence similarity between just two proteins. The usefulness
  of an HMM is directly related to the amount of care that is taken in chosing the
  seed members, building a good multiple alignment of the seed members, assessing
  the level of specificity of the model, and choosing the cutoff scores correctly.
  In order to properly assess what functional relevance an above-trusted scoring HMM
  match has to a query, one must carefully determine what the functional scope of
  the HMM is. If the HMM models proteins that all share the same function then it
  is likely possible to assign a specific function to high-scoring match proteins
  based on the HMM. If the HMM models proteins that have a wide variety of functions,
  then it will not be possible to assign a specific function to the query based on
  the HMM match, however, depending on the nature of the HMM in question, it may be
  possible to assign a more general (family or subfamily level) function. In order
  to determine the functional scope of an HMM, one must carefully read the documentation
  associated with the HMM. The annotator must also consider whether the function attributed
  to the proteins in the HMM makes sense for the query based on what is known about
  the organism in which the query protein resides and in light of any other information
  that might be available about the query protein. After carefully considering all
  of these issues the annotator makes an annotation.

comments:
- Transitive assignment of GO terms to a gene based on a curator's judgment of its
  match to a sequence model,such as a Pfam or InterPro entry, that has manually curated
  GO annotations, mappings to GO terms, or a description from which GO terms can be
  inferred. A statistical model of a sequence or group of sequences is used to make
  a prediction about the function of a protein or RNA. Annotations are created when
  a curator evaluates the results, using criteria that include excluding false positives
  and ensuring that the annotation is accurate for all matches. Statistical scores
  (such as e values and cutoff scores) and the functional specificity of the model
  may also be (but are not always) considered. Annotations resulting from the transfer
  of GO terms use the 'ISM' evidence code and include an accession for the model from
  which the annotation was projected in the 'with' field (column 8).

comments:
- 'Current genetic and molecular studies in many model organisms are aimed at understanding

  had a very shallow representation of processes pertaining to the nervous system.
  In June 2006, curators from MGI and ZFIN met with researchers studying central nervous
  system development to improve the representation of these processes in GO. In particular,
  emphasis was placed on three areas that are being addressed actively in current
  research: forebrain development, hindbrain development and neural tube development.
  This collaboration resulted in the addition of over 500 terms that reflect the development
  of the forebrain, the hindbrain, and the neural tube from the perspective of biological
  process and anatomical structure.'

title: Manual transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to homologous
  complexes by curator judgment of sequence, composition and function similarity
comments:
- Method for transferring manual annotations to an entry based on a curator's judgment
  of its similarity to a putative homolog that has annotations that are supported
  with experimental evidence. Annotations are created when a curator judges that the
  sequence, composition and function of a complex shows high similarity to another
  complex that has annotation(s) supported by experimental evidence (and therefore
  display one of the evidence codes ECO:0000353 [IPI] or ECO:0005543). Annotations
  resulting from the transfer of GO terms display the ECO:0005610, ECO:0005544 or
  ECO:0005546 evidence codes and include an accession for the complex from which the
  annotation was projected in the 'with/from' field (column 8). This field MUST contain
  a Complex Portal accession identifier. Putative homologs are chosen using information
  combined from a variety of complementary sources. Potential homologs are initially
  identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST. Homologous relationships
  are then verified manually using a combination of resources including sequence analysis
  tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases such as Ensembl Compara,
  INPARANOID and OrthoMCL, as well as other specialised databases such as species-specific
  collections (e.g. HGNC's HCOP). In all cases curators check the alignments for each
  complex component and use their experience to assess whether similarity is considered
  to be strong enough to infer that the two proteins have a common function so that
  they can confidently project an annotation. While there is no fixed cut-off point
  in percentage sequence similarity, generally proteins which have greater than 70%
  identity that covers greater than 90% of the length of both proteins are examined
  further. Whilst we expect subunit composition to be conserved between closely related
  species, this is not an absolute rule and orthologous complexes may differ if a
  subunit cannot be traced in one species or is experimentally shown not to be present.
  When there is evidence of multiple paralogs for a single species, multiple variants
  of the complex can be inferred.

comments:
- 'GO terms are manually assigned to each HAMAP family rule. High-quality Automated
  and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteins (HAMAP) family rules are a collection
  of orthologous microbial protein families, from bacteria, archaea and plastids,
  generated manually by expert curators. The assigned GO terms are then transferred
  to all the proteins that belong to each HAMAP family. Only GO terms from the molecular
  function and biological process ontologies are assigned. GO annotations using this
  technique will receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA).
  These annotations are updated monthly by HAMAP and are available for download on
  both GO and GOA EBI ftp sites. To report an annotation error or inconsistency, or
  for further information, please contact the GO Consortium at gohelp@genome.stanford.edu

title: OBSOLETE Portable Annotation Rules
comments:
- The JCVI is developing a collection of mixed-evidence annotation rules, under the
  working name BrainGrab/RuleBase (BGRB). A rule has two parts. The first is the set
  of conditions that must be met for the rule to fire. The second is the set actions
  to be taken for rules that have fired. BGRB rules are designed to serve as proxies
  for the annotators that create them. They have very high fidelity but may have low
  coverage. Types of evidence used in combination include HMM hits and BLAST matches,
  hits to neighboring genes, pathway reconstruction reports from the Genome Properties
  system, and species taxonomy. BLAST matches are described by a number of separate
  parameters for raw score, percent sequence identity, and coverage of total sequence
  length by the match region. These parameters are customized for each protein family
  in order to achieve high fidelity in automated annotation systems. The flexible
  syntax makes it possible to use existing protein family classifiers, such as Pfam
  and TIGRFAMs HMMs, in new ways. It is especially useful in assigning GO terms to
  proteins such as SelD (selenide, water dikinase) that have different roles in different
  contexts.

title: Manual transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to orthologs
  by curator judgment of sequence similarity.
comments:
- 'Method for transferring manual annotations to an entry based on a curator''s judgment
  of its similarity to a putative ortholog that has annotations that are supported
  with experimental evidence. Annotations are created when a curator judges that the
  sequence of a protein shows high similarity to another protein that has annotation(s)
  supported by experimental evidence (and therefore display one of the evidence codes
  EXP, IDA, IGI, IMP, IPI or IEP). Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO terms
  display the ''ISS'' evidence code and include an accession for the protein from
  which the annotation was projected in the ''with'' field (column 8). This field
  can contain either a UniProtKB accession or an IPI (International Protein Index)
  identifier. Only annotations with an experimental evidence code and which do not
  have the ''NOT'' qualifier are transferred. Putative orthologs are chosen using
  information combined from a variety of complementary sources. Potential orthologs
  are initially identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST.
  Orthology relationships are then verified manually using a combination of resources
  including sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases
  such as Ensembl Compara, INPARANOID and OrthoMCL, as well as other specialised databases
  such as species-specific collections (e.g. HGNC''s HCOP). In all cases curators
  check each alignment and use their experience to assess whether similarity is considered
  to be strong enough to infer that the two proteins have a common function so that
  they can confidently project an annotation. While there is no fixed cut-off point
  in percentage sequence similarity, generally proteins which have greater than 30%
  identity that covers greater than 80% of the length of both proteins are examined
  further. For mammalian proteins this cut-off tends to be higher, with an average
  of 80% identity over 90% of the length of both proteins. Strict orthologs are desirable
  but not essential. In general, when there is evidence of multiple paralogs for a
  single species, annotations using less specific GO terms are transferred to the
  paralogs, however, annotations using more specific GO terms may be transferred to
  the most similar paralog in each species, this decision is taken on a case by case
  basis and may be influenced by statements by researchers in the field. Further detailed
  information on this procedure, including how ISS annotations are made to protein
  isoforms, can be found at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/ISS_method.html.'

title: Automated transfer of experimentally-verified GO annotation data to close orthologs
comments:
- This reference is used to describe functional annotations transferred from one or
  more reference ("source") organisms to a newly annotated ("target") organism on
  the basis of ortholog cluster membership. In detail, predicted (e.g. by AUGUSTUS,
  see doi:10.1186/1471-2105-7-62) or transferred (e.g. via RATT, see doi:10:1093/nar/gkg1268)
  gene models in the target genome are translated and processed by OrthoMCL 1.4 together
  with reference protein sequences to produce clusters of gene products derived from
  orthologous genes. For each cluster, GO terms are automatically transferred from
  source products to the target gene products if they are experimentally verified
  (IDA (ECO:0000314), IMP (ECO:0000315), IPI (ECO:0000353), IGI (ECO:0000316), (EXP
  ECO:0000269). They are tagged with the ISO evidence code and the "with/from" is
  populated with the source feature references (e.g. "GeneDB:LmjF.28.0960"). OrthoMCL
  runs are done using the parameterization suggested in the OrthoMCL algorithm document
  (blastall -F 'm S' -e 1e-5).
