## Automated transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to close orthologs.

Mouse Genome Database (MGD), The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and Rat Genome Database (RGD) have extensive procedures in place, overseen by expert curation, to establish orthology relationships between their genes. The Experimentally based annotations annotated by each group (IDA, IMP IPI, IGI, and EXP) are used to provide annotations  to the respective mouse and rat orthologs, and given the ISO evidence code and an entry in the inferred_from field to indicate the orthologous entity.
