## OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation based on research conference abstracts

Prior to 2008, FlyBase made GO annotations based on information in abstracts for research conferences, primarily the Annual Drosophila Research Conference and the European Drosophila Research Conference. We no longer curate conference abstracts and we are gradually replacing all abstract-based GO annotation with annotation based on experimental data in primary research papers.
