## Gene Ontology annotation based on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Subcellular Location vocabulary mapping, accompanied by conservative changes to GO terms applied by UniProt. 

Transitive assignment of GO terms based on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Subcellular Location vocabulary. UniProtKB Subcellular Location is a controlled vocabulary used to supply subcellular location information to UniProtKB entries in the SUBCELLULAR LOCATION lines. Terms from this vocabulary are annotated manually to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries but are automatically assigned to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation program.
Further information on these two different annotation methods is available https://www.uniprot.org/help/keywords. 
When a UniProtKB Subcellular Location term describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, a mapping is manually made to the corresponding GO term. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB Subcellular Location term is maintained by the EBI GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/spsl2go.
