GAF2.2 uses a wider set of relations (column 4). This rule processes older versions of GAF files to provide basic compatibility with the current GAF2.2 format.
GAF versions 2.0 or 2.1 may already have qualifiers: 
* If an annotation has a `RO_0002326 "contributes_to"` or `RO_0002325 "colocalizes_with"` qualifier, these are kept. 
* If both a `NOT` and another qualifier (`contributes_to` or `colocalizes_with`) are present, both are kept, pipe-separated. 
* If an annotation only has a `NOT` qualifier, it will added as a pipe-separated value, to the gene product to term (gp2term) relation assigned based on the following rule: 
* For `GO:0005554 molecular function` and subclass descendants: 
    * the relation is `RO:0002327 "enables"`. 
* For `GO:0008150 biological process`:
    * If the annotation is to the root term `biological process`, then the relation is `RO:0002331 "involved_in"`.
    * If the annotation is to is a subclass descendant of `GO:0008150 biological process` then the relation is `RO:0002264 "acts upstream or within"`.
* For `GO:0008372 cellular component` 
    * If the annotation is to the root term `cellular_component`, then the relation is `RO:0002432 "is_active_in"`.
    * If the annotation is to `"GO:0032991 "protein-containing complex"` or a subclass descendant of, then the relation is `"BFO:0000050 "part of"`
    * Else, the relation is `RO:0001025 "located in"`.
