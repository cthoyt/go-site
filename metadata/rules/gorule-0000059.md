GAF2.2 uses a wider set of relations (column 4). This rule processes older versions of GAF files to provide basic compatibility with the current GAF2.2 format.
GAF versions 2.0 or 2.1 may already have qualifiers: 
* If an annotation has a `NOT` qualifier, it is kept as a pipe-separated value. 
* If an annotation has a `contributes_to` or `colocalizes_with` qualifier, it is kept unchanged. 
* If both a `NOT` and another qualifier are present, both are kept, pipe-separated. `NOT` qualifiers are also kept, pipe-separated, when other relations are added as described after.
For annotations with no qualifier, or only a `NOT` qualifier, a relation is computed based on the following rule:
* For `molecular function` If the annotation is to `molecular function` or a subclass descendant, then relation is changed to `RO:0002327 "enables"`. 
* For `biological process`:
    * If the annotation is to the root term `biological process` then the relation should be `RO:0002331 "involved_in"`
    * If the annotation is to is a subclass descendant of `biological process` then the relation should be `RO:0002264 "acts upstream or within"`
* For `cellular component` 
    * If the GO Term is a subclass descendant of `"GO:0032991 "protein-containing complex"` then the relation should be `"BFO:0000050 "part of"`
    * If the annotation is to the root term `cellular_component` then the relation should be `RO:0002432 "is_active_in"`
    * Otherwise the relation should be `RO:0001025 "located in"`
