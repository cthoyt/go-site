When processing GAF version 2.1, if the qualifier field (column 4) does not have a relation
a relation should be computed based on the following rule:
* If the annotation GO Term is in `molecular function` then the relation should be `RO:0002327 "enables"`
* If the annotation GO Term is in `biological process` then the relation should be `RO:0002264 "acts upstream or within"`
* If the annotation GO Term is in `cellular component` then
    * If the GO Term is a subclass of `"GO:0032991 "protein-containing complex"` then the relation should be `"BFO:0000050 "part of"`
    * Otherwise the relation should be `RO:0001025 "located in"`

This is due to the other annotation formats having a richer set of Relations available to them. In order to interoperate between GAF 2.1
and other formats as other formats have a richer set of allowed relations, this will be a process to provide basic compatibility.
