### Context:

The Persona login system was used by TermGenie (TG) and Noctua to
authenticate users. However Persona has been retired
[as of November 30th, 2016](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona). Consequently
the GO software team (with help from Heiko Dietze) has migrated the
login infrastructure for these applications towards using GitHub.

### How does it work?

Both Noctua and TermGenie now authenticate users via their GitHub
credentials. To do so, they read the
[users.yaml](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/users.yaml)
that is used by applications written for the GO to coordinate user
information.

To work properly, an entry for a TermGenie-only should minimally include the
following stanzas:

* <b>uri</b> the unique identifier for a user
* <b>nickname</b> the common name for the user
* <b>authorizations</b> indicate the various access levels
  * <b>termgenie-go</b> for TermGenie login
    * <b>allow-write</b> to allow creation of new terms using the templates
    * <b>allow-review</b> to enable access to the commit review interface (typically for GO editors)
    * <b>allow-freeform</b> to enable access to TG free form
  * <b>noctua</b>
    * <b>go</b>
      * <b>allow-edit</b> for logins to the GO instance of Noctua
* <b>accounts</b> to register various login accounts to external sites
  * <b>github</b> should be included here, with your GitHub username as the value

To work properly, an entry for a Noctua-only should minimally include
the following stanzas:

* <b>uri</b> the unique identifier for a user
* <b>nickname</b> the common name for the user
* <b>organization</b> the common label for the current organization of the user
  * <b>noctua</b>
    * <b>go</b>
      * <b>allow-edit</b> for logins to the GO instance of Noctua
* <b>accounts</b> to register various login accounts to external sites
  * <b>github</b> should be included here, with your GitHub username as the value

Noctua also supports **groups** for users who have various
affiliations. If you're interested in using these, please contact the
GO Helpdesk.

Naturally, these can be mixed and matched as required for the user.

#### Example stanza

```yaml
-
  uri: 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9551-6370'
  xref: 'GOC:mec'
  nickname: 'Melanie Courtot'
  email-md5:

    - a1f4be95870984265a3b33604a963b01
  organization: GO
  authorizations:
    noctua:
      go:
        allow-edit: true
    termgenie-go:
      allow-write: true
      allow-review: true
      allow-freeform: true
      allow-freeform-litxref-optional: true
      allow-management: true
  accounts:
    github: mcourtot
```

### How do I login?

Once your metadata has been captured properly as per above, you should
be able to log in in your favorite web browser.

When you try an login, you should be presented with a login window like:

![Image of login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geneontology/go-site/master/documentation/images/login-tg-screenshot.png)

Enter your GitHub username and password.

If it is the first time you have tried to login to a particular application, you should be presented with a login window like:

![Image of scope authorization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geneontology/go-site/master/documentation/images/authorize-tg-screenshot.png)

Accept this and continue back to your application. For TermGenie, you
should be redirected to the TermGenie template page where you can
create your commit. For Noctua, click the **Return** button.

### What if it doesn’t work?

Check your metadata is correct and complete in the users.yaml file; if
it is not please
[create a ticket](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/issues). Remember
you need at a minimum a GitHub ID and authorizations for the
application that you want to use in the file (see above for full
details).

Check that you can login into [GitHub](https://github.com); if you
can’t and you know you have a GitHub account, there may be a temporary
issue with the GitHub server. Please try again later.  If you still
can’t login: please
[create a ticket](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/issues). Please
indicate *exactly* the steps you are following (and URLs) and what
happens/error messages.

### FAQs:

1. Do I still need my Persona username/password? <br>
No. Unless you have made special arrangements with the administrators,
everything is authenticated via GitHub.

2. (<b>TermGenie</b>) I was able to login using my Persona username and password but can’t commit <br>
If you don’t have a _github_ account in the users.yaml file, the system will as a fallback attempt to log you in using your Persona credentials. This still seems to work as of today (Dec 1 2016) but will not allow you to commit terms. For full TG functionality you *need* to log in using your GitHub credentials.
